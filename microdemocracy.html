# Microdemocracy

Microdemocracy is the collection of Knola techniques applied at the national level. As we refine the idea, we will assign different version numbers. Currently we're working on version 2018.01.

To understand how Microdemocracy works, let's consider how it differs from the contemporary political system in the United States.

<table>
 <tr>
  <th>United States 1787.027</th>
  <th>Microdemocracy 2018.01</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <p>**Representative**</p>
   Voters elect legislators, who record rules regulating government execution. Voters also elect a president, who oversees execution.
  </td>
  <td>
   <p>**Direct**</p>
   Government organizations gather guidance directly from the public, or the public can demand action via initiatives.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <p>**Periodic**</p>
   Voters elect agents every 2 to 6 years, mostly by visiting a polling place near their homes, and sometimes via postal mail.
  </td>
  <td>
   <p>**Continuous**</p>
   Most participants consider issues and register guidance once per month, primarily via personal computer or smartphone in about 30 minutes.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <p>**Surveyed**</p>
   Each election includes all voters, and legislative bill consideration includes all representatives.
  </td>
  <td>
   <p>**Sampled**</p>
   A statistical sample of the public participates in each decision, weighed by how much the choice impacts them.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <p>**Media-based**</p>
   Voters primarily receive information from the news media, and sometimes from candidates.
  </td>
  <td>
   <p>**Research-based**</p>
   Participants receive objective research and analysis specific to a decision. Input from participants also helps guide investigations.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <p>**Episodic**</p>
   State propositions and initiatives receive a simple yes/no vote, and failures are not reconsidered until years later.
  </td>
  <td>
   <p>**Iterative**</p>
   Decision managers gradually refine ideas, based on guidance provided by progressively larger groups of participants.
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

In some of these areas, the systems are similar if you compare legislators to participants. For instance, legislators are more research-based, particularly thanks to the Congressional Research Service. Also legislative bills are designed iteratively, particularly via the committee process.
