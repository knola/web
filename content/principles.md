<h2>Authenticity</h2>

<p>Decisions reflect the genuine wishes of the group.</p>

<p>In contemporary democracies, campaign finance pressure creates perverse incentives for candidates, and makes them vulnerable to influence from lobbyists. Meanwhile news media drives focus to sensational topics and away from important, but boring issues. The result is biased decisions, leaving voters with a persistent feeling of frustration.</p>

<p>Knola achieves authenticity by unlocking direct input. Every participant contributes to a random selection of decisions. So each decision consists of a natural cross-section of people's motivations. This structure naturally resists influence from politics and lobbying.</p>

<p>This shifts power from legislators to their constituents. Without the baggage of elections or resulting bias, we can finally make the best choices.</p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Decisions are powered by knowledge and foresight.</p>

<p>In modern elections, ballots are strongly influenced by voters' reactions to campaigns. Candidates' slogans, sound bites, and party affiliation is most of what we get. Reacting is natural, but reasoning leads to better outcomes, and data is the main ingredient in reasoning. Legislators receive much more data when crafting the law, but are still constrained by public perception.</p>

<p>Knola eliminates the consequences of ignorance by conjoining power and information. As a proposal forms, participants help identify the most important questions. Then researchers collaborate to gather and verify facts, analysts compete to produce the best predictions, and presenters vie to summarize with least bias.</p>

<p>The result is enlightened, rational participants, and wise choices.</p>
