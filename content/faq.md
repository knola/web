# Frequently Asked Questions

## Terminology

### What is an _heirloom democracy_?

An heirloom democracy is one whose foundations were designed before modern technology, for instance the federal government of the United States.

## Intentions

### Are you calling for a revolution?

No. We believe changes can and will be achieved gradually, most likely over decades.

## Principles

### Why not include an _accessibility_ principle?

We considered adding a principal covering our desire to make the process accessible by everyone. But ultimately we decided that it was implied by our [authenticity principle](principles). If the process systematically excludes a particular slice of the community, it can't be authentic.
