# Knowledge Labs

Knola aspires to empower groups to make smarter, faster decisions. We are a group of volunteers, performing [experiments](./process) in the field of _decision technology_, and building tools to help groups replicate successful processes.

Groups range from large to small: governments and communities, businesses and cooperatives, teams and families. If our work is successful, decision technology could contribute to every decision from your next President to your next vacation.

Microdemocracy is one way to apply these techniques to national decisions. Americans might find it easy to understand by [comparison](./microdemocracy) with their contemporary political system.
