Knola aspires to empower groups to make smarter, faster decisions. We are a band of volunteers, performing experiments in the field of _decision technology_, and building tools to help groups replicate successful processes.

Groups range from large to small: governments and communities, businesses and cooperatives, teams and families. If our work is successful, decision technology could contribute to every decision from your next President to your next vacation.

If this is interesting, email [team@knola.co](mailto:team@knola.co) to join the discussion.
