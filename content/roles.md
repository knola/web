# Decision Roles

Each deliberation using Knola's [process](process) has people participating in six primary roles.

<div class="doublet">
 <h2>Evaluator</h2>
 <p>Evaluators learn about a proposal via a short presentation, and share their feelings and recommendations. Most participants are evaluators, similar to voters in heirloom democracies. They don't require any special training or skills, and should only need 30 minutes for one proposal.</p>
</div>

<div class="doublet">
 <h2> Manager</h2>
 <p>The manager leads deliberation for a particular proposal. They bring together and coordinate among the team of participants, and choose next steps throughout the process. They guide the research by prioritizing questions, and in the end they summarize the results.</p>
 <!-- For smaller decisions, the manager might also assume the role of researcher, analyst, and presenter. -->

 <h2>Researcher</h2>
 <p>Researchers gather facts, to answer questions from the decision manager. They draw from both from existing data sources and their own direct investigations. They often record audio video and photographs, although their primary output is a fact list.</p>
</div>

<div class="doublet">
 <h2>Analyst</h2>
 <p>Analysts attempt to predict the future, in response to questions from the decision manager. They produce models and extrapolate from past data into the future. They refine their models over time, and thus their work spans many deliberations.</p>
</div>

<div class="doublet">
 <h2>Presenter</h2>
 <p>Presenters condense the facts and predictions into a short presentation for evaluators. Presentations might be text, audio, or even video. Sufficiently large decisions create redundant presentations to check for bias.</p>
</div>

<div class="doublet">
 <h2>Agent</h2>
 <p>The agent represents the people who would act on the decision, if it's made. They advise the decision manager on feasibility, risks, and other issues around execution. For public decisions, agents are generally government employees or contractors.</p>
