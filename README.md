# Knola website

Files are divided into directories:

*   `content`: documents, images, and other public resources.
*   `npm`: Node.js packages, see npmjs.com.
*   `tools`: scripts for building and deploying content.

The following directories are generated by the build, but not committed to the
Git repository (https://github.com/knola/web):

*   `_build`: HTML files generated from Markdown.
*   `_public`: collected public content in serving layout.
